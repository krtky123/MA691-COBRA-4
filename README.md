## 🐍 What is COBRA?

COBRA stands for COmBined Regression Alternative. It is a new method for combining several initial estimators of the regression function. Instead of building a linear or convex optimized combination over a collection of basic estimators r1, . . . , rM, we use them as a collective indicator of the proximity between the training data and a test observation. This local distance approach is model-free and very fast. More specifically, the resulting nonparametric/nonlinear combined estimator is shown to perform asymptotically at least as well in the L2 sense as the best combination of the basic estimators in the collective.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Members

This project has been made by AB Satyraprakash, Kartikay Goel, Samiksha Sachdeva, Jatin Dhingra, Himanshu Yadav. The work has been mentored by Prof. Arabin Kumar Dey.

## 📝 Project description
This project uses the famous titanic dataset, and implements COBRA to make accurate prediction after combining different estimators. The dataset has been taken from the Kaggle competition: <br>[Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 🎯 Accuracy
Using COBRA, an accuracy of **83.76%** has been obtained. For the complete implmentation on Google Colab see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Imperial-lord/757b1d870f00253afed056d7324cb1d9).

## 🌐 Presentation
